// What is node js

// Earlier Javascript used to run on browser(compiler) only 
// Develop android/ios applications
// Develop applications for smart watches, smart fridges etc...

// Node js is a runtime environment through which javascript can run and compile anywhere else apart from the browser
// Nodejs also utilizes the JS V8 Engine



// Installing Node.js

// How to check nodejs is installed


// Why you use Node
// Its very faster
// Has a good design paradigm
// Sockets in nodejs which is used for real time connectivity
// It allows you to use same language throughout frontend and backend (JS)

// Javascript is a single threaded language


// Applications of nodejs
// React
// Angular
// Vue


// npm
// Node Package Manager is responsible for a lot of tasks
// 1. Install package dependencies

// Initializing node app
// You can use npm init to initialize node js application
// You can also use npm init --y (to answer yes to all questions)

// Explanation of package.json
// 1. To download dependencies/libraries/framework in your project
// 2. To download developer dependencies
// 3. To run and write your own scripts for the project

// Dependencies
 - Which will be part of your project when you bundle it, and is required by your project

 

// Dev Dependencies
 - It is only used for development 
    - For example - Sass compiler


// Nodemon - Nodemon is a package through which you can run your server simultaneously so that if you make 
// any changes it executes them automatically


// loading core modules
 - We load other modules/javascript files using module.exports

// creating a node server
    - Import Http module using require
    - Create server using http.createServer
    - Listen the server using http.createServer.listen

// global object
// console.log(global)

// React
// React is a library made by Facebook for making frontend applications
// We use JSX in React (Javascript + XML)

// Why it got popular ?
 // Single Page Application (SPA)
    // Single Page applications allows you to use components/pages without reloading them so that it doesn't affect
    // user experience and performance
 // 

// How it is better from Javascript
    -- Because it works on SPA concept
    -- It is easier to write web pages in React
    -- You can make use of reusable components/pages


// COMPONENTS
    - Components are building blocks of the website
// Creating a react project
 -- When we install node
    - npm
    - npx 

    You can use npx create-react-app "projectName" for creating a new react project
